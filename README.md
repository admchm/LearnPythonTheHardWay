# Learn Python The Hard Way - Exercises

This repository contains the code I wrote while working through Zed Shaw's course, **Learn Python The Hard Way**. The repository is structured with exercise files saved in a systematic manner for easy reference and study.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each containing exercise files and their respective study drills. The file naming convention is as follows:

- **Exercise Files**: `ex<number_of_exercise>.py`
- **Study Drill Files**: `study_drill_<number>.py`

Each folder corresponds to a specific section of the course, ensuring a clear and logical structure for navigation.

## Purpose

I have decided to keep this code for a few reasons:

1. **Reference Material**: This code serves as a valuable reference for understanding and revisiting concepts learned during the course.
2. **Learning Resource**: It acts as a useful resource for others who might be taking the same course or looking for examples of Python code based on **Learn Python The Hard Way**.

## Contact

If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
