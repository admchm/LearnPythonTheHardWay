## Study Drills:

## 2 - Change the prompt variable to something else entire

# Answer: 
# script, user_name = argv
# prompt = '$ '

# print(f"Hi {user_name}, I'm the {script} script.")
# print("I'd like to ask you a few questions.")
# print(f"Do you like me {user_name}?")
# likes = input(prompt)

# print(f"Where do you live {user_name}?")
# lives = input(prompt)

# print("What kind of computer do you have?")
# computer = input(prompt)

# print(f"""
# Alright, so you said {likes} about liking me.
# You live in {lives}.  Not sure where that is.
# And you have a {computer} computer.  Nice.
# """)

## 2 - Add another argument and use it in your script, the same way you did in the 
## previous exercise with first, second = ARGV.

# Answer: 
# script, user_name, age = argv
# prompt = '$ '

# print(f"Hi {user_name}, you're {age} years old. I'm the {script} script.")
# print("I'd like to ask you a few questions.")
# print(f"Do you like me {user_name}?")
# likes = input(prompt)

# print(f"Where do you live {user_name}?")
# lives = input(prompt)

# print("What kind of computer do you have?")
# computer = input(prompt)

# print(f"""
# Alright, so you said {likes} about liking me.
# You live in {lives}.  Not sure where that is.
# And you have a {computer} computer.  Nice.
