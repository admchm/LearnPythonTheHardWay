## Study Drill #2: 
## Is it possible to use a class like it's an object?

# Answer:
# Yes, it is possible. In Python, classes themselves are objects, 
# specifically instances of their metaclass, typically type unless a 
# different metaclass is explicitly specified. This means you can manipulate
# and use classes much like objects.
