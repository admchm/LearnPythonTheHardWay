## Study Drill #2: 
## At the end of the script is a puzzle. I'm taking the return value of one function and using it as the argument 
## of another function. I'm doing this in a chain so that I'm kind of creating a formula using the functions. It 
## looks really weird, but if you run the script, you can see the results. What you should do is try to figure out 
## the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations. 

# Answer: I typed in my prediction in ex21.py it was correct!
