## Study Drill #6
## Find 10 examples of things in the real world that would fit in a list. 
## Try writing some scripts to work with them.

# Answer:

#1. Shopping List - Much like a Python list, a shopping list is an 
# ordered sequence of items that you intend to purchase.

#2. Train Schedule - This can be thought of as a list of train departures
# and arrivals, each entry containing information like time and 
# destination, organized in the order of occurrence.

#3. Playlist of Songs - A list that includes various songs to be played 
# in a specific order, similar to a list in Python where each element is 
# accessed sequentially.

#4. To-Do List - An ordered collection of tasks to be completed, much 
# like a list in Python where each task can be checked off (or removed 
# from the list) once completed.

#5. Guest List - A sequence of names of people invited to an event, where
# each name can be accessed and managed individually, just like elements 
# in a Python list.

#6. Class Roster - A list of student names in a class, typically ordered 
# alphabetically or by some other criteria, analogous to a list in Python.

#7. Book Series - A sequence of books in a series read in a particular 
# order, similar to how elements in a list are arranged in a specific sequence.

#8. Assembly Line - Products moving through an assembly line can be thought 
# of as a list, with each product being a list item that undergoes various 
# processes in a sequential order.

#9. Recipe Ingredients - The ingredients for a recipe listed in the order 
# they need to be used, comparable to items in a Python list used sequentially 
# in a program.

#10. Timeline of Events - Events placed in chronological order, similar 
# to how data can be structured in a list to represent sequences over time.
