# Final Challenge
# You now have to figure out what this code spells out:

# cars[1][1][1]
# cars[1][1][0]
# cars[1][0]
# cars[3][1][1]
# fruit[3][2]
# languages[0][1][1][1]
# fruit[2][1]
# languages[3][1][0]
# Don't attempt to run this in Jupyter first. Instead, try to work out manually what each line will spell out, then test it in Jupyter.
