# I will give you a list name and a piece of data in the list. Your job is to figure out what indexes you need to get that information. For example, if I tell you fruit 'AAA' then your answer is fruit[0][2]. You should attempt to do this in your head by looking at the code, then test your guess in the Jupyter.
