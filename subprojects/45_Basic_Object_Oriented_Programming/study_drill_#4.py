## Study Drill #4
## Compare this solution to the one you made in Exercise 44. Which one
## do you prefer? Even if you prefer the previous, please don't write 
## more code like that. It's only a training exercise.

# Answer:
# I prefer this solution, because it was so much easier to write. It was
# easier to refactor, to read. To be honest, previous solution was pretty 
# painful to write.
