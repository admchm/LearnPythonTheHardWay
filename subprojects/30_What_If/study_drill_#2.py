## Study Drill #2: 
## Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces?

# Answer: It needs to be intended because identation is used to define 
#         the structure of the code, so:
#         - it is being used for block definition
#         - readability
#         - preventing errors
#         - convention (recommended by PEP 8)
