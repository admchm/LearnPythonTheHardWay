## Study Drill #4: 
## Make changes to the math and then try to predict what output you'll get.

# Answer:

def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
    print(f"You have {cheese_count} cheeses!")
    print(f"You have {boxes_of_crackers} boxes of crackers!")
    print(f"Man, that's not enough for a party")
    print(f"Get a blanket.\n")
    
cheese_and_crackers("a" + "b", 10 + 6) # predicted output - ab, 4
